# SecureHealth

SecureHealth is a decentralized application (dApp) designed to allow patients to share their health data securely and anonymously. This dApp facilitates the secure sharing of health information between patients, doctors, and researchers while ensuring the privacy of the data.

## Purpose

The main purpose of SecureHealth is to provide a platform where patients can share their health data securely and anonymously with authorized doctors and researchers. This helps in advancing medical research while protecting patient privacy.

## How it Works

1. **User Registration and Verification**: Patients and doctors register on the dApp and verify their identities.
2. **Data Upload**: Patients upload their health data to SecureHealth.
3. **Data Encryption**: The data is encrypted and anonymized using Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP).
4. **Data Sharing**: Patients can grant access to specific doctors or researchers.
5. **Data Access**: Doctors and researchers can access the data they have been granted permission to view and analyze it.

## Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Using Scroll as the Blockchain

**Advantages:**
- **Low Transaction Fees**: Scroll has lower transaction fees compared to Ethereum, making it more economical for users.
- **High Performance**: Scroll provides higher transaction speeds and scalability, allowing for faster and more efficient data processing.

**Disadvantages:**
- **Less Mature Ecosystem**: Scroll does not have as extensive and mature an ecosystem as Ethereum, which might limit developer resources and support.
- **Lower Security**: Scroll's smaller miner network compared to Ethereum might pose some security risks.

### Scenario 2: Using Ethereum as the Blockchain

**Advantages:**
- **Large Ecosystem**: Ethereum has a vast user and developer ecosystem, providing more resources and support.
- **High Security**: Ethereum's extensive miner network ensures higher security for the dApp.

**Disadvantages:**
- **High Transaction Fees**: Ethereum has higher transaction fees, which can be costly for users.
- **Scalability Issues**: Ethereum can face lower transaction speeds and scalability issues, which can lead to performance problems during high usage.

## Decision and Justification

**Chosen Blockchain: Ethereum**

**Reason:**
The high security and extensive ecosystem provided by Ethereum make it the preferred choice for SecureHealth. Given the sensitivity of health data, the security and reliability of Ethereum outweigh its higher transaction fees and scalability issues. Optimized smart contracts and usage scenarios can help manage the costs and performance challenges.
